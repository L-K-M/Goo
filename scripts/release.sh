# Cuts a release: bumps versionName in app/build.gradle.kts (versionCode is
# auto-incremented — Android requires a new code per release), updates the
# README version marker, commits, tags "v<version>", and with --push pushes
# branch + tag — which triggers .github/workflows/release.yml to test, build
# the release APK (signed with the checked-in debug keystore, see
# docs/decisions/0002), and publish the GitHub Release.
#
#   scripts/release.sh 0.2.0          # bump, commit, tag v0.2.0
#   scripts/release.sh 0.2.0 --push   # …also push the commit + tag (CI then publishes)
#   scripts/release.sh                # tag the current committed version as-is
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh [X.Y.Z] [--push]
# Shared engine: https://github.com/L-K-M/release-tool (this stub only sets config).
